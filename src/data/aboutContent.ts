  'Born on September 1, 1980, in Hyderabad, Telangana, Tirumala Dilip Kumar grew up in a household where cricket was a passion but not a guaranteed career path. With limited resources, young Dilip funded his cricketing ambitions through mathematics tuition, teaching schoolchildren to pay for coaching and equipment.',
  'His playing career spanned Hyderabad\u2019s age-group and senior domestic teams, giving him a practical understanding of the game\u2019s physical and mental demands. But it was his instinct for mentoring \u2014 helping teammates improve their fielding technique and awareness \u2014 that set him apart.',
  'The transition from player to coach began formally in 2004 with the BCCI Level 1 certification. By 2009, he was coaching at the Hyderabad Cricket Association and the Deccan Chargers in the IPL, where he worked under Australian fielding coach Mike Young. It was here that Dilip absorbed baseball-influenced catching and throwing techniques that would later become his signature.',
  'A decade at the National Cricket Academy (2011\u20132021) shaped the next generation of Indian cricketers. Players like Shubman Gill, Yashasvi Jaiswal, Tilak Varma, and Axar Patel all trained under his watch.',
  'In November 2021, Dilip was appointed Fielding Coach of the India senior men\u2019s team under Rahul Dravid. The results were immediate: India\u2019s fielding was transformed from a weakness to a defining strength.',
  'When Gautam Gambhir succeeded Dravid as head coach in July 2024, Dilip was the only coaching staff member retained, a testament to his irreplaceable impact. Under his stewardship, India has won four major ICC trophies: the 2023 Asia Cup, 2024 T20 World Cup, 2025 Champions Trophy, and 2025 Asia Cup.',
