  'Tirumala Dilip Kumar was born on September 1, 1980, in Hyderabad, in the erstwhile state of Andhra Pradesh (now Telangana), into a family where cricket was more than a sport \u2014 it was a way of life. Growing up in modest circumstances, he developed an interest in cricket at a young age despite limited resources and family support for a career in sport. Academically inclined, he completed a Bachelor\u2019s degree in Computer Science from Aurora\u2019s Degree and PG College, Hyderabad.',
  'To fund his pursuit of cricket as a young man, Dilip took up part-time work as a mathematics tutor for school children. The income from these classes supported both his playing ambitions and, later, his enrolment in the BCCI\u2019s coaching certification programme. He has said of this period that mathematics tuition was what funded his ability to play cricket, and that he gave it up once he began representing the state.',
  'Dilip represented Hyderabad at various age-group levels and went on to play senior cricket for the state. Though he did not pursue a career as a professional cricketer, his years as a player across different levels of domestic competition gave him a practical understanding of the game\u2019s demands, particularly in the field. Over time, he found that his interest in mentoring fellow cricketers had begun to outweigh his own playing ambitions.',
  'This led him to make a conscious decision to move into coaching. He began the BCCI\u2019s Level 1 coaching course in 2004 and completed the Level 2 certification in 2007, marking his formal transition from player to coach. Today, he holds the BCCI Level 3 coaching certification \u2014 the highest awarded by the Board of Control for Cricket in India \u2014 along with NLP Practitioner and S&C Level 1 qualifications.',
  'In November 2021, his appointment as the Fielding Coach of the Indian Senior Men\u2019s team under Rahul Dravid marked the culmination of a journey that began in local academies and domestic dressing rooms. When Gautam Gambhir succeeded Dravid as head coach in July 2024, Dilip was the sole member of the outgoing support staff to be retained \u2014 a testament to his irreplaceable impact.',
